                        <p class="alg-text-light">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
                            has roots in a piece of
                            classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                            Latin
                            professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
                            words,
                            consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                            classical
                            literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                            1.10.33
                            of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
                            BC. This
                            book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
                            line of
                            Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                            interested.
                            Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also
                            reproduced in
                            their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
